           MediaFest22 is a unique and inspiring journalism convention experience, 
           bringing together professional journalists, student journalists and college 
           media advisers from every area of journalism, from across the country, 
           to our nation's capital. Attendees will hear from renowned speakers; 
           benefit from hands-on workshops, general sessions and concurrent breakout 
           sessions; enjoy networking opportunities; soak up everything the exhibit 
           hall has to offer; celebrate during awards presentations, banquets and 
           receptions; unwind during tours of the city and historical sites - and so
            much more!

           Learn about journalism and media trends, new digital tools, emerging technologies and career opportunities. But that's just the beginning. You'll also get to delve into topics like tools for investigative journalism and newsroom diversity, as well as covering hot button issues like immigration and healthcare.
